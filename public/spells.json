It can have the appearance of any mundane environment or structure, such as a glorious cathedral, a clearing in a forest, a comfortably furnished cavern, or anything else one can imagine. All demiplanes have finite, unbreachable boundaries, which might resemble stone, wood, or something more unnatural, such as a wall of mist or unceasing void.</p>\n<p>Demiplanes have environmental conditions as appropriate for the Material Plane, though the primary caster can dictate a general climate or light level, as well as whether the demiplane experiences seasons or a day-night cycle.

This advice is rarely more than two or three sentences long, typically spoken in Sussuran if you understand it, and Common if not. If you can't hear, the spirits blow small objects around to mimic written words or sign language. If following the advice poses great danger, the spirits typically note this risk but rarely go into detail. The advice is instant, so the spell doesn't have a duration.</li>\n</ul>"},{"id":"B3tbO85GBpzQ3u8l","name":"Wish-Twisted Form","level":5,"traits":["sorcerer","transmutation"],"rarity":"uncommon","duration":"varies","description":"<p>You focus your magic upon an enemy, wishing for their defenses to fail and turning their strengths into weaknesses.
